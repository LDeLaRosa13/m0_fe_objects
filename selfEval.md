# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- Researching can become overwhelming really quickly if you dont know what you're looking at. It is fun to find new solutions to things you are understanding though!
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- I could be better about taking more regular breaks. I get up every few hours to go outside with my dogs so that's helpful. Staying focused hasn't been much of a problem because I know there is a deadline.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- I want to learn more about how each data type works together and how i can mazimize my productivity with less struggle. I'm interested in getting deeper into objects and functions!
